## Project structure

### Modules

### 1.shared

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, that is, the code you share between platforms.

This `shared` module is also where all the  Compose Multiplatform code is witten.

It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`.
The `shared` module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular Android library.
